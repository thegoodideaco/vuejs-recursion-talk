## This is how you pull it off

### ListItem component

We need to provide a default slot, in two separate areas of the component

These slots will both bind the node data, and we will wrap it around the content
that is currently there

In the recursive element instance, we add a template around the slot, and we
provide a scoped slot on the template itself

### ListItem Wrapper

Last thing we need is a wrapper. This wrapper will include the `ListItem`, and we
will insert the wrapper's slot inside of the `ListItem` instance
