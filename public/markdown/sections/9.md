# Making it better

There's obviously many ways we can improve upon this component. However, we want
this to be a base component for the most part, so it is easily re-usable in
different areas, or with different data and possible interaction logic

We will only implement a few things to keep things simple. I'm saving the best
for last

## 1. Collapsible Nodes

This is probably the most needed feature for a TreeList. I can't think of any
sort of tree display where you can't expand or contract these nodes. So we
should integrate it into our component

## 2. Custom Content (advanced)

It's not only allowing custom content to be injected, but it gives us reference
to each component instance's scope. By doing this, we can customize how this
tree behaves, without even stepping foot inside
