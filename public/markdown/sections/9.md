# Making it better

The way I look at it, is that you should put any logic dealing with the
navigation, or transformation of the data itself in the ListItem, and try to
keep everything else external, specifically for visual concepts, as well as
keeping scope as easy to manage as possible

## 1. Collapsable Nodes

This is probably the most needed feature for a TreeList. I can't think of any
sort of tree display where you can't expand or contract these nodes. So we
should integrate it into our component

## 2. Custom Content (advanced)

It's not only allowing custom content to be injected, but it gives us reference
to each component instance's scope. By doing this, we can customize how this
tree behaves, without even stepping foot inside
