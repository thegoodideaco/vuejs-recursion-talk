# Recursive Tree (simple)

Tree Lists are generally well known, as well as their functionality. They can
filter items, drag and drop, sort, filter, you name it.

Let's forget about all of that for a second. For now, let's imagine a very
simple multilevel list, with some very basic functionality.

> Will show a label of some sort

> Can collapse and expand sections

> Can emit user events when interacted with

This can be achieved by creating a component that uses itself, until there are
no more children available.
