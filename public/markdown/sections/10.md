# 1. Collapsable Nodes

In order to make this happen, we need to look at each part

> ### An expanded identifier object for each item to determine if it's collapsed or not

Each instance of a ListItem should have a conditional specifying if it should
show it's children

> ### A mechanism to allow the user to toggle the value of that identifier

Include a way to allow the user to target any instance,and expand or collapse it
by any sort of user action

> ### Optionally, a way to recursively expand or contract all sub nodes

Allow the ability to expand or contract recursively if the alt button is pressed
