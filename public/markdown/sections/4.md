# Recursive Tree (simple)

## Entry point is important

Let's break down a tiny section of this pattern. You have a `ul` element, and
some `li` elements within the ul.

At first glance, it would seem that the `ul` would be the starting point, making
you think that the component you need to recursively render is a list.

However this is not the case. It's actually the `list item`. Hierarchical data
tends to have a single root node, we just don't see it displayed in a tree list.

a `ul` basically represents the collection of child nodes, and not the node
itself.
