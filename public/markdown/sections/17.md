## Does it work?

# `HELL YES`

By using scoped slots, we have made this component much more reusable

We also managed to achieve this without writing any code

We can also bind the VNode of each instance, so that we can collapse or expand
each item from within our own scope

## Final thoughts

Functionality for rendering in Vue is outstanding. Although we were able to
achieve this with the template syntax, we can create components that can do much
more

Because we are letting Vue do the recursion, things such as `depth-first search`
or creating a flat map is something Vue shouldn't handle

Adding animation to expanding and collapsing lists can be done by wrapping a
`transition` component around each `UL`
