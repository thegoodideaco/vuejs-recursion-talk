# Testing

Based on the look of this list, it seems like they are collapsed! If we did this
right, when we click on a title, that item will expand and collapse

# `HELL YES!`

So, to recap

> 1. We created a way to recursively (and reactively) render elements based on a
>    data hierarchy

> 2. We added logic to hide and show subitems

> 3. And we implemented a click event for the user to perform the toggle
