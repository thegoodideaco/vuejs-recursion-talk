### Something is missing...

We now know that this does actually render, but there is lack of interactivity.

> We can't collapse or expand nodes

> No event handling for user input

> Poor display of information

> Nodes must always be inside a 'children' keyed object

> No search / filter support

> Poor display of information

> Scope is too internal. Reliant on custom styling, unable to move outside of
> scope

#### Where does this logic go?

I am sure there are many approaches to this, Element-UI is an interesting
example, and others that have slightly different approaches
