## Let's display some data!

Our ListItem component will have a couple basic properties:

> ### `nodeData`
>
> This represents the current data object being recursively iterated

> ### `nodes`
>
> A Computed property containing our child nodes

## Rules to follow

> ### `Specifying a Name`
>
> Components can recursively invoke themselves in their own template. However,
> they can only do so with the name option

> ### `Infinite Loops`
>
> Avoid the “max stack size exceeded” error by making recursive invocation a
> conditional rule

> ### `Circular References`
>
> Components can actually be each other’s descendent _and_ ancestor in the
> render tree. Therefore, you must specify the component in the `beforeCreate`
> method
