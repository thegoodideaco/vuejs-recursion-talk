# Custom Content

### Scoped Slots are amazing

With scoped slots, you inject anything you want inside of this component. Logic
for interaction stays with your view, while at the same time giving you scope
within each iterated item, even when it's recursive.

Normally alot of this goes into a more custom render method, which is totally
doable, especially when you have a component that uses itself recursively

But you can actually do this with the template syntax, and with barely any
refactoring

We do this by creating a `wrapper` component, which acts as the main source root

This component is a `ul` which goes back to what I said about the `entry` point

The reason this is crucial, is because of the nature of slots within vue
components. You cannot have two defaults slots in a component, and this is
a problem when a component uses itself
