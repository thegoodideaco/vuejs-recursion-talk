# Vue + Recursion

Vue is hierarchical by nature. Components get nested within components, and even
the dom elements themselves, are hierarchical.

Reactivity in Vue is also very beneficial. The key reason being that these
updates are asynchronous.

Whenever a data change is observed, it will open a queue and buffer all the data
changes that happen in the same event loop. If the same watcher is triggered
multiple times, it will be pushed into the queue only once.

This buffered de-duplication is important in avoiding unnecessary calculations
and DOM manipulations. Then, in the next event loop “tick”, Vue flushes the
queue and performs the actual (already de-duped) work.

_My point being, that Vue does alot of the optimization for you. By creating
nested components, you are essentially performing an asynchronous recursion
already_
