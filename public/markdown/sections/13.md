# 2. Custom Content

### Now for the fun part

Let's imagine for a moment, that you have a folder hierarchy of files. And one
thing you will want to do, is show a checkbox next to each item, allowing for
some multi-selections

Where would that logic go? Well, obviously we can include that inside of this
component, and make it an optional feature.

So let's say we do add it in there. We can include a prop called `checked` to
determine visibility.

But wait, since it is a visual element, you have to style it. so that
would go into this component as well.

Cool, logic is in, it all works, client is happy

Oh, wait. The client wants those checkboxes to be switches. Also they don't like
the overall feel.

Also, based on the dataset, each item has a url for an icon representing a
folder or a file, so you add that in the template as well

Client now wants a site map, that you can use to navigate the pages on their website.
