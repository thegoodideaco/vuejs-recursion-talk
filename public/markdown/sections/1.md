# Hello!

#### Let's talk about recursion

_"In order to understand recursion, one must first understand recursion."_

I'm sure most of you have gotten very familiar with recursive functions. But for
those who haven't, recursion is
`the repeated application of a recursive procedure or definition.`

Of course when dealing with recursion, you have to make sure you don't fall into
the abyss of infinity, so usually there is always a mechanism to break the
pattern, and stop looping forever.

Recursion can be done in a number of ways, but one I particularly like working
with is Hierarchal datasets. These work great, because the repeatable pattern is
there, and because of the uni-directional flow, it makes our recursive methods
finite.

## ok, let's talk about recursion
